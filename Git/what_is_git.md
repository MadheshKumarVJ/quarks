Git is a tool for tracking changes in software code, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:

- **Version Control**: Git helps developers track changes to files over time and revert to previous versions if needed.
  
- **Distributed**: Unlike other systems, Git gives each developer a complete copy of the project's history, making it resilient and flexible.
  
- **Branching and Merging**: Git simplifies creating separate work areas for new features or fixes, merging changes back into the main project effortlessly.
  
- **Collaboration**: It enables teamwork by managing concurrent changes and merging contributions seamlessly.
  
- **Open Source**: Git is free and widely used in software development, originally designed by Linus Torvalds for managing Linux development.
  
- **Platforms**: Supported by GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, offering additional tools for managing projects.
